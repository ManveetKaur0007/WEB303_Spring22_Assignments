    <h3>Her Show "A Little Late with Lilly Singh"</h3>
    <p>
        "A Little Late with Lilly Singh" makes its debut on September 16, 2019. The comedian, actress, social media sensation, producer and author of
        “How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life,” Lilly Singh brings her unique perspective to late night as she hosts celebrity interviews, 
        talks current events, performs musical and sketch comedy, plays games, and more.<br/><br/>
    
        A self-proclaimed “unicorn,” the multi-faceted star’s debut in the late-night landscape is especially noteworthy as she’s a Canadian woman
